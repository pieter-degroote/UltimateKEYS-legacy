# UltimateKEYS - Compose Key Sequences (Linux)

To apply the additional Compose Key sequences, put the file ".XCompose" into the user's home directory (~).

[The ".XCompose" file can be found in the regular UltimateKEYS repository.](https://github.com/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS/tree/master/linux-xcompose)

Note that the base keyboard layout should also be added via either XKB or Xmodmap to enable the layout on Linux.
