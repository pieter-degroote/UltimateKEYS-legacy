# UltimateKEYS Legacy (Windows/Linux)

**International US QWERTY layout with AltGr (Right Alt) dead keys (Compose Key).**  
This layout is based on US QWERTY, and has borrowed some aspects from EurKEY and US-International.

This release (and repository) only contains the main keyboard layout of UltimateKEYS.

The additional Compose Key sequences (Multi_key) have not been included, since these may change more frequently over time.

**Also note that the MSKLC version (for Windows) does not have the Compose Key, since MSKLC does not support multiple keystrokes as a sequence for a dead key.**

**=&gt; Legacy version of UltimateKEYS Core**  
**=&gt; Note that the legacy version is now aligned with&nbsp;: &nbsp;[UltimateKEYS Core](https://github.com/pieter-degroote/UltimateKEYS-core)**
