# UltimateKEYS Legacy for AutoHotkey v2/v1.1

## Prerequisites

These AutoHotkey scripts are highly customizable editions of UltimateKEYS Legacy. To work properly, the Windows main/base keyboard layout has to be set to either&nbsp;:

- **Hausa (Latin - Nigeria)** =&gt; AltGr assigned to UltimateKEYS Legacy (best layout, based on US QWERTY).
- **United States (US)** =&gt; Right Alt assigned to UltimateKEYS Legacy (second best layout).

*Note about the standard base US layout&nbsp;:*

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default 'Alt + Shift' sequence will interfere with the AHK scripts.  
To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:  
*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*  
Please note that on the standard US QWERTY, the sequence 'Left Alt + Shift' also gets mistakenly triggered by 'Right Alt + Shift', resulting in an unexpected keyboard layout change.
